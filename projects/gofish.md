The client for the game was programmed using vanilla JavaScript and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for graphics. The server runs on nodejs and serves the files with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/). Real-time client-server communication happens over a [socket.io](https://socket.io/) channel. Thanks to [Glitch](https://glitch.com) for hosting this and many other open source projects for free. This game doesn't work well on touchscreens.
