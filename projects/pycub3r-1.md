This robot is based on the [MindCub3r](https://mindcuber.com/mindcub3r/mindcub3r.html). However, I replaced the software with a custom python program running through [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/). This video shows a simple demo of the robot doing and undoing the checkerboard pattern on a Rubik's Cube. It took a lot of fine-tuning for me to get the robot to perform this algorithm without making any mistakes or jamming up.

The source code for this project is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/bmxguy100/pycub3r).
